# Biography

Mr. Fangyi Zhang is currently a PhD candidate in the Australian Centre for Robotic Vision (ACRV) at QUT node. His PhD topic is "Learning Real-world Visuo-motor Policies from Simulation". His current research interests include robotic vision, robotic manipulation, deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning.

He obtained his B.Eng. degree in Automation from East China Jiaotong University in 2010, followed with three years' work experience on R&D of locomotive control algorithms and electrical systems in the CRRC Zhuzhou Institute from 2010 to 2013. In 2014, he stayed for one year at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, as a research assistant, doing research on VLC-based indoor localization and 2D-laser based 3D sensing.
